The Bermejo border is super calm. Sleeper bus from Salta to Tarija $49000.

Starting with Tarija is beautiful. Quiet and neat town. People are friendly and there's no feeling of insecurity. Food is plentiful and cheap. The **Pata y Perro hostel** is an excellent volunteering opportunity.

## Internet

- Works quite well in hostels
- It's recommended to use an Entel chip for good coverage throughout the country
- To register the line, the quickest way is to go to an Entel branch, otherwise from a working phone call 108 and provide the device's IMEI number

## Migration

- Make sure they stamp your passport, or at least give you the stamped paper if using your ID (recommended)
- Migration officials often check hostels to ensure there are no illegal residents
- If you exceed the allowed time (usually 3 months for Argentinians) you'll be fined and can't re-enter for 5 years. They are VERY strict on this issue
- We crossed through Bermejo from Salta, quick overnight bus without problems. The border was empty and we resolved everything quickly. Recommended!

## Accommodation

- Accommodations are cheap, don't skimp to ensure you have basic services and hot water.
- There are plenty of volunteering opportunities! Take advantage as people are also quite hospitable

## Money

- Everything is handled in cash
- It's best to exchange at the border or make friends with someone who receives pesos through a contact
- Dollars are not exchanged at a good rate

### Applications / Virtual Wallets

- Wise doesn't work for withdrawing from ATMs, it has a VERY low exchange rate and charges VERY high fees:
  - BCP ATM fee 55.70BS
  - Mercantil Santa Cruz ATM fee 48.40BS
  - Banco Sol ATM 200BS -> 29.11 USD (6.87USD) ‚ùå
  - BancoFie ATM 200BS -> 36.22USD ‚ùå

## Food

- BY FAR THE BEST
- It's very cheap to eat in the markets and the food is very good
- There aren't many vegetarian options but you can talk to the ladies to prepare something
- You can also go shopping at the markets to cook, it's always better to go to those further from the center
- You need to use some judgment about where to eat based on how clean the kitchen looks
- It's very useful to pay attention to where most locals eat

## Transportation

- There are several types of transport. Taxi, Taxi-Trufi, Trufi and Micros
- Trufis are the best for moving around the city, they usually charge no more than 2Bs
- For slightly longer distances, you can take a Taxi-Trufi which is a bit cheaper than a regular Taxi
- If at any point you get a drunk driver or one who drives very badly, don't hesitate to get off and take another transport

## Safety

- As always, you need to be careful with your belongings but in general we never felt in danger or scared

## Coworking

- There are some co-working spaces, it's also cheap to have a snack in some cafes
