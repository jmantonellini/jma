## Internet

- Make sure I have internet, buy a SIM card
- I can't activate a SIM card in Brazil because they ask for an ID, unless someone lends me one.
- Make sure to have Roaming set up from here just in case
- iPhone eSIM through an application (maybe 30USD 5GB in Brazil). It's configured so that roaming is used from there. Saves the day, **AloSim**
- eSIMs work with networks in each country. eSIM coverage map (**routes and 4G coverage level**)
- Claro works quite well.

## CPF

- It's very useful to have the CPF as it provides the following advantages:
    - Use PIX (one of the most important) to pay like Mercado Pago everywhere
    - Allows you to open bank accounts, invest, etc.
    - Enables you to get a cell phone SIM card
- You need to bring documentation to the Bank of Brazil
- Contact of the lady who helps with paperwork in Arraial do Cabo:
- Steps to do it:
    1. Complete the [form](https://servicos.receita.fazenda.gov.br/Servicos/CPF/InscricaoCpfEstrangeiro/default.asp)
    2. If you entered Brazil with a passport, put the passport number; if you used your ID, put the ID number.
    3. Put the CEP and address of the hostel where you're staying. (Lograduro: RUA)
    4. When you finish, this message appears:
        
        ![CPF](/src/countries/br/cpf.png)
        
    5. Select for printing and save a copy. Then you need to bring it printed.
    6. Now you have to go to the nearest "**Secretaria da Receita Federal do Brasil**" and present the requested documentation:
        1. Document or passport (whichever you used to complete the form) and a copy of it
        2. Printed form
    7. It can take 3 to 5 days usually and it's sent directly to your email
    8. Done! ðŸ˜„

## Accommodation

- Airbnb is expensive. **Never rent something without reviews** especially in Brazil.
- Hostels are good for meeting people
- Selina never fails
- Che Lagarto is also good. Hostel chains in general don't fail, even if they're more expensive.
- [Arraial do Cabo] Hostel A Coroa very good and at a good price. Ask for the mixed three-bed room.
- If you're going to stay for a while, it's better to ask Argentinians who work in hostels and that you meet. Someone always knows someone who rents a room, and it's cheaper than paying for a hostel daily.

## Money

- Be careful with Payoneer regarding the multi-factor authentication with SMS
- Always have a cash reserve just in case
- Try Wise with the card
- Use the Payo card for everything. Be very careful with card cloning.
- In supermarkets, for example, use cards because it's safe. For smaller, less secure purchases, always use cash.
- Don't withdraw money from ATMs in random places. Always go to the bank to withdraw more safely. ATMs that are a bit far away might have skimmers.
- It's a bit of a lottery how they charge interest. It depends on each bank.
- I have to exchange to reais no matter what, dollars don't exist in Brazil.
- **Arrive in the country with that currency beforehand,** even if it's just a little for safety. Withdraw at Airports (not recommended) or other places.
- The Real - Dollar conversion is done directly by Payoneer. Check the percentage later with Payoneer.
- When you withdraw from the ATM, it gives you options, it's **Credit Card withdrawal**.
- **Getting the CPF helps with many procedures**

**Santander in Rio de Janeiro**

I withdrew 400BRL

The ATM told me they would add 20BRL in interest

It ended up taking:

### Applications / Virtual Wallets

- **Revolut:** try it, recommended by a European freelancer
- **Wise:** try it
- **Payoneer:** Used with the card, withdrawing reais from reliable bank ATMs. I can also pay in supermarkets and reputable businesses.
- For Brazil, you must use Pix, and as a requirement, you need to have a CPF

## Mobility

- Always have money in your pocket just in case.
- Uber with the Payo card for sure (it doesn't let me)
- Be careful in big cities, if you need to be tough, be tough
- Very useful for finding trips to various places: https://www.rome2rio.com/
Check the schedules with the company's website.
- Facebook with community, city, state groups, etc. Join and ask questions, see how things are going. Someone always appears to give you a hand.
- **Bla bla car** to move to beaches cheaper
- **Buser** for medium/long distance buses
- Be careful with stops because they'll leave you if you don't get on in time. They don't check passengers.

- Be careful
- Trust your intuition
- Preferably don't wear jewelry

- Make an appointment and go to the Argentine consulate with printed form and receipt
- Request for criminal record check
- Pay at a bank near the consulate: 158 BRS
- They take all your fingerprints and make the criminal record request
- They send you a form by email to request the apostille
- When you receive the criminal record certificate by email, complete the form for the birth certificate and for that certificate
- Send those two forms by email and they'll send you the fee
- The best way to pay it and for it to be quick is to use Pix, so ask someone to pay it and that's it
- It's 148 BRS each, as there are two it's a total of: 296 BRS
- Everything should be apostilled in approximately 5 days. I received it that same afternoon.
- I had to pay 5.25 BRS more for each one. In total, it's another: 10.5 BRS
- Now with all that ready, you have to gather this documentation:
