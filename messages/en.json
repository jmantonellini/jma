This helped me develop a lot of skills and experience.\n<p>I learned many languages and tools but more importantly I adquired many soft skills and strengthend my\n\t\t\t\t\tadaptability skills.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tNow I'm on a journey to become a nomad freelancer and work on projects which I'm really\n\t\t\t\t\tpassionate about.

Volunteering allowed me to travel\n\t\t\taround many countries and meet amazing people. I learned many new skills and even more things\n\t\t\tabout myself and life itself.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI once heard that travelling is the school of life.. and I've been proof of that. I strongly\n\t\t\tbelieve volunteering is the best way to travel. Either your do it alone or with a partner.\n\t\t</p>","volunteering_benefits":"<p>\nLike everything in life, volunteering may not be right for everyone. It takes a lot of courage to move through different places where you don't know what or who awaits you. There's a high level of uncertainty that constantly tests your willpower.\n</p>\n<p>\nSelf-discovery.</br>\nBy constantly dealing with unfamiliar people and in environments that are out of your control, you learn to adapt and new skills flourish.</br>\nThat's why, if you think you couldn't do it, I recommend it even more. You'd be surprised how much you can discover about yourself! The worst that can happen is that you don't like it and return to your safe place. But you'll have tried, and you'll surely have learned something new.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou save A LOT of money.</br>\nMost volunteer opportunities offer room and board, which are the two most expensive things when traveling. Not only that, but many volunteer opportunities can open doors to new projects and collaborations, for which you'll even end up earning extra money.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou make a LOT of friends.</br>\nOf all the times I've traveled so far, volunteering is where I've made the most friends. It feels great to know that there are places in different parts of the world where there are people who would welcome me.</br>\nImagine everything you can learn (and teach) by making friends with people from cultures completely different from your own.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou'll have INFINITE anecdotes to tell.</br>\nThere's not much more to say about this... just that if you're open to the experience, crazy and fun things can happen to you.\n</p>","benefits":"Befenits","my_experiences":"My experiences","country_not_found":"Country not found..","pricing_title":"Pricing","pricing_one_time":"one-time","pricing_mantainence":"Mantainence","pricing_start_project":"Start a project","pricing_starter_title":"Starter site","pricing_starter_price":"$800","pricing_starter_description":"Ideal for personal sites or small businesses.
